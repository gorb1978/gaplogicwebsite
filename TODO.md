# TODO (Claude-facing)

Working list of things to pick up next session on this repo. Check this file at the
start of a session and update it (mark done / add new items) whenever you touch
`apps.html`, `privacy.html`, or `index.html` — don't leave it stale.

## Open

- [ ] Once Netlify is linked (see `HUMAN_TASKS.md`), push a trivial whitespace-only
      change, confirm a new deploy appears in the Netlify dashboard, then revert it —
      this was step 4 of the original CD-setup plan and never got verified because
      the GitHub OAuth link is still blocked.
- [ ] Swap the `splash_logo.png` placeholder icons for GapSeizure and GapReintro once
      real app icons exist in their repos (`gapseizure/assets/images/`,
      `gapreintro/assets/images/` — both empty as of 2026-08-12).
- [ ] Swap the `splash_logo.png` placeholder for GapNotes once that app actually
      exists (no folder for it anywhere in `StudioProjects` as of 2026-08-12 — it's
      a pure "coming soon" placeholder card right now).
- [ ] **GapRegister went live on Play Store 2026-08-14** — its `apps.html` Download
      button still points to the `#` placeholder. Josh scoped 2026-08-15's fix to
      naming + feature-list only, so the link update is intentionally still
      outstanding — get the real Play Store URL from Josh and swap it in.
- [ ] Update "Download on Google Play" `#` placeholder links to real Play Store URLs
      as each remaining app (GapVitals, GapCalc, GapJournal, GapBudget, GapFluid,
      GapWater, GapSeizure, GapReintro) actually goes live — check each folder's
      `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` for status before assuming "live."
- [ ] Periodically re-sweep each app folder's most recent .md docs (README, HANDOFF,
      TODO, HUMAN_TASKS, SPRINT_HISTORY, STORE_LISTING) against `apps.html` /
      `privacy.html` — app docs update faster than the site, so treat the site as
      the thing that's usually behind unless proven otherwise (verified 2026-08-12,
      found several apps had stale copy: GapCalc, GapRegister, GapJournal all had
      shipped features missing from their site cards).

## Recently resolved

- [x] GapRegister's `apps.html` header ("Offline Checkbook" → "Income & Expense
      Tracker") and Free Features list (added home-screen widget + font scale
      100%–200%) brought up to date, 2026-08-15 — matches live Play Store listing
      and the app's own README.md/STORE_LISTING.md. privacy.html and the YouTube
      embed were already correct and untouched.

## Notes / decisions to remember

- App naming on the site follows the "every app starts with Gap" convention — even
  when an app's own project docs use a different internal/working name (e.g.
  `clearbudget` folder's own README calls it "ClearBudget," but the site correctly
  calls it **GapBudget** per Josh's explicit correction on 2026-08-12; don't rename
  it back based on that folder's internal docs).
- IAP product IDs in several apps intentionally keep legacy/old-name prefixes
  (e.g. GapJournal's IAPs use `com.gaplogic.sleepdraft.*`) — that's deliberate,
  not a bug, don't "fix" it.
